# Wave Simulation

Codes for Seismic Wave Simulation. This project consists of implementation of wave equation using finite-difference methods and Stereo Modeling By [Yang et al](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2478.2011.01033.x)

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Anaconda.7.3.0
numba
```

## How to use
The simulation runs with python script. You need to load the package of '''wave''' and instantiate ''' wave ''' class. The arguments are the grid size of the velocity model, the duration of simulation and the velocity array in form of 2D numpy array.
gen_records.py is a python script example

```
python gen_records.py
```
